## Adding to the Kubernetes learning path
As the name implies, the Kubernetes learning path is intended as a curated day by day learning path for those interested in learning more about Kubernetes. 
While it is possible to pick and choose activities of interest, the activities are grouped into day1-day50 to provide some structure to the learning activities.
If you have come across an resource that you think will be a great addition to this learning path, please 

1. Review the [guidelines](guidelines.md) to ensure your resource meets the Kubernetes learning path. 
2. Take a look at the current resources and think about where the resource you want to add belongs e.g. would it be useful for someone just starting out? Or is the resource more appropriate for someone after they've become familiar with the basics? Should it replace an existing resource because it's better and newer or is this an additional resource?
3. Navigate to the appropriate Day folder, select the .md file and edit the file
4. Add a new header line for your resource using `## your headline`
5. Add a brief description for your resource in italics using `*your description text*`
6. Add a hyperlink to the resource e.g. `http:\\somewebsite.com\link`
7. Check your spelling and grammar
8. Create a Pull Request with the name of the Day.md file in the title, such as "Update Day06-15.md"
9. Add some details in the body of the Pull Request about why you think your resource belongs on the Kubernetes learning path and why at this specific point in the path
