## Adding to the Kubernetes workshops section

This section is intended to list Kubernetes focused workshops that can serve as useful resources for someone learning about Kubernetes.

The intent of this section is NOT to list each and every workshop on Kubernetes out there. Instead we want to list 3-5 good worrkshops that can assist someone in learning Kubernetes concepts in depth. 

##Suggest a new interactive tutorial:
1. The wortkshop must be focused on Kubernetes or a specific aspect of Kubernetes.
2. The workshop must be recent and up to date, and freely available (i.e. must not require payment)
3. To add a new worshop, select the kubernetes-workshops.md file in this folder and edit the file
4. Add a new header line for the workshop using `##  workshop title` 
5. Add a brief description for the workshop in italics using `*workshop description text*`
6. Add a hyperlink to the workshop e.g. `http:\\somewebsite.com\link`
7. Check your spelling and grammar
8. Create a Pull Request with the name of the .md file in the title, ie "Update kubernetes-workshops.md"
9. Add some details in the body of the Pull Request about why you think this workshop belongs in this file
10. Submit the request

To contribute to this section, [edit this file](kubernetes-workshops.md)
