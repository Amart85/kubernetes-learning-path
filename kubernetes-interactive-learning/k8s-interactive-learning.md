Now that you understand the basic Kubernetes concepts, it’s time to get some hands-on time and see them in action. 

These hands-on, interactive learning modules let you run your first container on Kubernetes, and enable you to explore basic Kubernetes concepts like YAML definitions, networking, secrets, and application deployments from source code.

# Explore Kubernetes with Katacoda
*Participate in six hands-on, interactive learning modules through Katacoda to run your first container on Kubernetes. The modules explore basic concepts like YAML definitions, networking, secrets, and application deployments from source code.*

## Launch a single-node Kubernetes cluster
*Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. The tool runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop, enabling you to start developing with Kubernetes right away.*

## Start containers using Kubectl
*In this scenario, you’ll learn how to use Kubectl to create Deployments and Replication Controllers and expose them via Services without writing YAML definitions. This allows you to quickly launch containers onto the cluster.*

## Deploy containers using YAML
*This module builds on the previous one to help you launch your Deployments and Replication Controllers. It teaches you how YAML definitions define Kubernetes Objects and how to schedule those objects for deployment.*

## Use Kubernetes to manage secrets
*Learn how to manage secrets using Kubernetes. Kubernetes allows you to create secrets that are mounted to a pod, which means they can only be managed via an infrastructure team in  a secure way—instead of using passwords stored within artifacts.*

## Get an introduction to networking
*Kubernetes’s advanced networking capabilities allow pods and Services to communicate inside and externally to the cluster’s network. You’ll learn about a variety of Kubernetes services, including Cluster IP, Target Ports, Load Balancer, and more.*

## Deploy a service into Kubernetes
*In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the basics of deploying a  service into Kubernetes from source code to a running Kubernetes cluster.*
