## Adding to the Kubernetes Patterns and Architectures section

This section is intended to list Kubernetes specific Patterns and Solution architectures in key areas. We would like to capture each pattern and solution architecture as its own section so it can serve as a source of deeper guidance on the topic. 

Microservices in the first topic in this section and we invite your input on other key patterns and solution architectures that should be captured here. 

##Suggest a new pattern or solution architecture addition:
1. The pattern or solution architecture must be focused on Kubernetes or a specific aspect of Kubernetes.
2. To add a new pattern or solution architecture, create a new .md with an approrpiate name using the pattern or solution architecture in this folder and edit the file
3. Add a new header line for the pattern or solution architecture using `##  title` 
4. Add a brief description for the pattern or architecture in italics using `*pattern/architecture description text*`
5. Add one or more hyperlink resources to the pattern or solution architecture e.g. `http:\\somewebsite.com\link`
6. Check your spelling and grammar
7. Create a Pull Request with the name of the .md file in the title, e.g. "Update kubernetes-pattern.md"
8. Add some details in the body of the Pull Request about why you think this workshop belongs in this file
9. Submit the request
