Building great software is often similar to constructing a great building that can stand the test of time.  And like physical buildings, great software requires good architecture and use of well understood patterns. 

In this section, you will learn about key software patterns and architectures as they relate to Kubernetes and AKS. Learn these repeatable, generic patterns and proven architectures in order to build more reliable and efficient Kubernetes solutions.
