Itâ€™s time to go deeper and learn about Kubernetes and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) core concepts. 
Each article in this section covers a specific topic and only takes a few minutes to read, so you can understand the basics of Kubernetes in no time.

**Overview of Kubernetes and core concepts** so you can develop a good understanding of the Kubernetes Control plane, node and node pools, pods, name spaces, DaemonSets, deployments, YAML files, and more.

**Access and Identity in Kubernetes** and concepts such as Role-Based Access control(RBAC) and roleBindings.

**Security in Kubernetes** is a critically important topic and the article discusses how to secure your applications in Kubernetes and manage Kubernetes Secrets.

Other topics in this section include **networking, scaling, and storage**.
