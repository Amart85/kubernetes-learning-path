Kubernetes learning path is designed to be a curated learning path for those interested in Kubernetes in general. The learning path may also include Azure Kubernetes Service and related resources where exposure to a managed Kubernetes service faciliates learning about Kubernetes. 

# Guidelines
New content submitted for inclusion to the Kubernetes learing path must meet the following guidelines:
* Resource is relavant to Kubernetes
* Resource is publicly available
* Resource content is current and up to date
* Resource is published by an authorative source

# Notes
As this is a curated learning path, the owners of this list may reject a resource that is too narrowly focused or where other similar content already exists in the learning path.
