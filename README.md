Kubernetes learning path is designed to be a curated learning path for those interested in Kubernetes in general. The learning path may also include Azure Kubernetes Service and related resources where exposure to a managed Kubernetes service faciliates learning about Kubernetes. 

The intent is to the harness the community input to capture the best content related to Kubernetes in one place and make them available to the community as a curated, well maintained resource on GutHub. Additionally, we will use it to create a variety of more customized resources to drive awareness and education about Kubernetes. 

For example, it will serve as the basis for future updates to the [Kubernetes Learning Path "Zero to Hero"](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/kubernetes-learning-path/). 

Another example is the Kubernetes Learning Path poster recently made available to attendees at Ignite 2019. And of course other potential uses that are yet to be conceived.

# Guidelines
New content submitted for inclusion to the Kubernetes learing path must meet the following guidelines:
* Resource is relavant to Kubernetes
* Resource is publicly available
* Resource content is current and up to date
* Resource is published by an authorative source

# Notes
As this is a curated learning path, the owners of this list may reject a resource that is too narrowly focused or where other similar content already exists in the learning path.
